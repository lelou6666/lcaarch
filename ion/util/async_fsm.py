    A FSM derivative that performs its actions associated with state transitions asynchronously.

    The AsyncFSM does not change its state until the action calls back succesfully.
    The action need not return a deferred, it is wrapped in defer.maybeDeferred.

    An AsyncFSM offers additional improvements over a regular FSM:
    - Transition actions may or may not return deferreds (they are wrapped in defer.maybeDeferred)
    - Offers a way to perform many transitions at once without knowing all the input symbols 
      required to get to that state (see run_to_state). It computes the list of symbols
      via get_path.
    - Notice of state transitions: you may add callables (via add_state_change_notice) that
      get called on every successful state transition. The callable takes a single param,
      a reference to this AsyncFSM. This can be used to update interested parties when a
      multi stage transition via run_to_state is being run.
